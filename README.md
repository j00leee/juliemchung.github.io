# My Portfolio

## Author
Julie Chung - [Github](https://github.com/j00leee) - [Portfolio](https://j00leee.github.io/portfolio) - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julieminjungchung/)

## Goals
What information I want to convey to someone looking at my portfolio is:
 - my name
 - where to contact me
 - my skills
 - some information about who I am personally
 - some projects I've done

## Features
I've used a single-page layout, so all the information you need is on one page only, with a couple of navigation menu links on the top right to help you scroll to what you care about most. The portfolio site also has an optimised layout for mobile so it can be viewed properly on any device.
